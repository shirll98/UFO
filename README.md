## Overview of project 
The purpose of this analysis is to build a HTML page that will filter data and information from a data.js file using javascript. This page will be interactive and allow users to input information and pull information that is relevant to their interests. 
## Results 
The HTML page will allow users to filter with 5 different options: date, city, state, country, shape which allows for multiple search filters that will narrow down the data. Upon entering the desired filter, the page will show sightings for that search but "resets" the search when the page is refreshed. 

Attached are the pictures for the HTML page.

## Summary 
One drawback of this webpage is that the filter searches are very specific. If you entered the city, capitalization the first letter of the city name, then the HTML page would not be able to match it. Two recommendations that I have are to include a "lose" match for the filters. This will enable users to type in search words that are not exact matches to the data. Another recommendation would be to include a message if the users entered the wrong word for example "Did you mean this....?"
